This is the API repo for my side project, Masterchef Compendium (MCC). It's a project that aggregates episode challenge data with recipe data so that it's navigable and queryable. The idea is that this data can be mined to answer questions like what cooking technique for salmon has fared the best in all challenges where salmon was presented as a dish. Or what percentage of Italian dishes has Joe Bastianich shit on when judging? How many have truly amazed him and what were they? What is Gordon Ramsay's consistently favored dish across all seasons of MC? Is there one?

I love cooking and have always been fascinated by cooking competition shows, especially Masterchef. I created this in an effort to prepare myself if I ever wanted to sign up as a contestant, which I will probably never, ever do. Basically, if I were to prepare for this show as a contestant, I would want to focus my efforts on practicing recipes, techniques, and ingredients that have been demonstratably successful on the show.
